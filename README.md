MDJson is a tool that I have developed in my free time, being completely useless.

To run this, you need to add both scripts to your html project.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/blueimp-md5/2.16.0/js/md5.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zNotChill/MDJson/main/v1.js"></script>
```

This allows you to use the function ```mdjson``` from the MDJson v1.js. This may change, but it should never. So you shouldn't have to worry about changing the script name. The function is ```mdjson(string)``` and returns every character parsed as md5. This is very spammy and I wouldn't be surprised if nobody uses it, if anyone does, yeah
